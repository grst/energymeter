# Monitoring energymeters and SMA devices using a Rasperry Pi Zero

I live in a house with four flats, each of which is owned by a different member of my family.
In 2024 we jointly invested in a 23kWp photovoltaics (PV) system with 22kWh battery storage. To optimally share the energy
across the entire house, we now only have one contract (and one electricity meter) with the grid operator. Behind
the main meter, the consumption of each flat is measured using an Eltako electricity meter (as shown below) which we
use to split the electricity cost.

With a PV system (and maybe in the future, dynamic tariffs), the cost per kWh is not fixed. It is basically
free when there's sun and expensive otherwise. Thus ideally, we could not only record _how much_ energy is consumed,
but also _when_. Like that we can learn more about our energy consumption, optimize it towards consuming more
self-generated energy, and split the cost more accurately.

Luckily, the Eltako meters can be read out via a S0-interface. This is a very simple interface that sends one electric pulse for each consumed Wh. 
Moreover, the SMA inverter and battery system can be queried using a Modbus interface via the local network such that we can retreive information about energy production and storage. This repo contains a Python
package I run on a Rasperry Pi zero to count the pulses received via S0 and to query the modbus interface in a fixed interval. The resulting
measurements are saved in a SQLite database that can be used for analyzing and visualzing the energy consumption and production. 

## Hardware setup

| Energy meter with S0 port | Rasperry Pi Zero |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![eltako meter](img/eltako_meter.jpg) | ![rasperry_pi](img/rasperry_pi.jpg) |

The S0 interface of the Eltako energy meters is connected to the GPIO ports of a Rasperry Pi zero. 
In principle every cable should do, but I use Ethernet cables for that because they are shielded and conveniently offer
twisted wire pairs. According to the S0 protocol, one pulse is sent by the energymeter every time a certain unit of energy is consumed.
This value depends on the meter, but in my case it's one pulse per Wh. Of each energy meter, the S0- port is connected to the GND of the raspberry pi. The S0+ port to any of
the GPIO ports. GPIO ports must be set to Pull-up. We can then detect a falling edge signal.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, you can get it e.g. from [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).
Then, install the `energymeter` package from this git repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grst/energymeter.git
pip install -e ./energymeter
```

## Configuration

You need to configure your energymeters in `src/energymeter/config.yml`. It is distinguished between S0 (GPIO) and Modbus (TCP/IP) meters. Three types of measurements can be recorded that will be 
saved in different SQL Tables: 
 * Pulse (S0 pulse counter)
 * Power (current power in W)
 * CumulativePower (cumulative power, i.e. counter readout in Wh)

Example:

```yaml
meters:
  GPIO:
    Meter1:
      id: 1
      db_table: Pulse
      gpio_port: 21
      imp_per_kwh: 1000
  Modbus:
    Sunny_Tripower_curr_power:
      id: 2
      description: "Current PV Power (W)"
      db_table: CumulativePower
      modbus_register_address: 30775
      modbus_register_type: U32
      ip_address: 192.168.1.147
```

Additionaly, the configuration defines the path to the sqlite database and the interval for polling the modbus interface
```yaml
db_con: "sqlite:///./data/pulse.sqlite"
# interval for polling modbus interfaces in seconds
interval: 5
```

## Usage

The package provides a `energymeter` binary that can be executed from the command line and immediately starts monitoring and recording the data, e.g.

```bash
> energymeter
Setting up meter 'Sunny_Island_Batterieleistung' with ID 105 for register 30775 on 192.168.193.156
Setting up meter 'Sunny_Tripower_Gesamtertrag' with ID 106 for register 30513 on 192.168.193.147
Setting up meter 'Sunny_Island_Netzbezug' with ID 107 for register 30581 on 192.168.193.156
Setting up meter 'Sunny_Island_Einspeisung' with ID 108 for register 30583 on 192.168.193.156
Sunny_Tripower_Gesamtertrag	106	2024-07-04T18:51:24.655898+00:00	4973419
Sunny_Island_Batterieleistung	105	2024-07-04T18:51:24.664780+00:00	1652
Sunny_Island_Netzbezug	107	2024-07-04T18:51:24.694910+00:00	59830
Sunny_Island_Einspeisung	108	2024-07-04T18:51:24.725720+00:00	1969330
```

For serious monitoring, it's better to create a systemd service that will be automatically restarted should the program fail, or the Rasperry Pi reboot, e.g. due to a power outage. 
An example file is provided in `energymonitor.service`, but you might need to adapt it. The file needs to be copied to `/etc/systemd/system`, then activate the service wite

```bash
systemctl enable energymonitor.service
systemctl start energymonitor.service
```

Check the status with

```bash
systemctl status energymonitor.service
```

## pvtop - monitor the PV system from the terminal in real time

Additionally, there's the `pvtop` binary, which reads out only the modbus interfaces and prints the results to the terminal, e.g.

```bash
> pvtop
Description	Value
State of Charge (%)	98
Current PV Power (W)	135
Grid supply (W)	0
Grid Feed-in (W)	22
Power output of storage system (negative, when charging) (Wh)	600
Total yield inverter (Wh)	4973429
Total grid supply (Wh)	59840
Total grid feed-in (Wh)	1969340
```

Combine this with unix tools to update it every 2 seconds and format it more nicely:
```bash
watch "pvtop | column -t -s $'\t'"
```
